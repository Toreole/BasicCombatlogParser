Just a reminder for myself and any possible others that are looking into this code.

Within EventData, there's two kinds of classes:
______Params and ______Data

Params relates to anything that is dynamic, like health, damage amounts, etc.

Data is anything that is static, meaning that there *would* be duplicate objects. To avoid creating lots of duplicates, a HashSet will be used.
