# BasicCombatlogParser

Sooo I've been really neglecting this in favour of just contributing some small things to the WoWAnalyzer project.

And I don't really think that this will be a thing anymore, as there isn't really any need for it. 
The Warcraftlogs website is already plenty fast and reliable, and WoWAnalyzer has a really solid framework to build things upon.
